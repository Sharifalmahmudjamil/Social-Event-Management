# MCQ TEST
 1. Write the correct answer from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).
let greeting;
greetign = {};
console.log(greetign);
A: {}
B: ReferenceError: greetign is not defined
C: undefined
# Answer: A:{}
 Explanation:

  <i> This is because the greetign variable is assigned an empty object in the second line of code. The console.log() function then logs the value of the greetign variable to the console, which is the empty object. </i>

2. Write the correct answer from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

sum(1, "2");
A: NaN
B: TypeError
C: "12"
D: 3
# Answer: D:3
Explanation:

<i>This is because the sum() function simply adds the two arguments that are passed to it. In this case, the arguments are the number 1 and the string "2". JavaScript will automatically convert the string "2" to a number before adding it to the number 1. This is called type coercion. </i>

3. Write the correct answer from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).
const food = ["🍕", "🍫", "🥑", "🍔"];
const info = { favoriteFood: food[0] };

info.favoriteFood = "🍝";

console.log(food);
A: ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']
B: ['🍝', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']
C: ['🍝', '🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']
D: ReferenceError
# Answer : A: ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']
Explanation:
<i>This is because the info object is a separate copy of the food array. When the favoriteFood property of the info object is changed to , the food array is not affected. </i>

4. Write the correct answer from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).
function sayHi(name) {
  return `Hi there, ${name}`;
}

console.log(sayHi());
A: Hi there,
B: Hi there, undefined
C: Hi there, null
D: ReferenceError
 # Answer : B: Hi there, undefined

Explanation:

<i> This is because the sayHi() function expects a name to be passed to it as an argument, but none is passed in the console.log() call. When a function argument is missing, JavaScript assigns it the value undefined. </i>

5. Write the correct answer from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).
let count = 0;
const nums = [0, 1, 2, 3];

nums.forEach((num) => {
  if (num) count += 1;
});

console.log(count);
A: 1
B: 2
C: 3
D: 4
#### Answer C:3
Explanation: 
 <i> This is because the forEach() method iterates over the nums array and calls the callback function for each element in the array. The callback function checks if the element is greater than zero, and if it is, it increments the count variable.</i>
